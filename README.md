# Chat Theatre

A Chat Theatre is a online chat, discussion, and storytelling/roleplaying environment that leverages old-style mud/mush commands and text-dominant virtual objects, but with all the advantages of a modern HTML5 web interface, including clickable links, visual maps, popup windows, etc. It is based on SkotOS, a 4th-generation text game engine that has been in use for online games for over 20 years.
